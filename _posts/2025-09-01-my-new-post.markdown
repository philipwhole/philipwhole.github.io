Dropbox desktop â†’ Uploads only changed/new files, very efficient (block-level sync).

SharePoint / OneDrive desktop â†’ Same as Dropbox, uploads only changes (block-level sync).

Google Drive desktop â†’ Uploads only changed/new files, but always re-uploads the whole file when modified (less efficient for large files).

ðŸ‘‰ For lots of small office files â†’ all three are fine.
ðŸ‘‰ For large files (backups, videos, databases) â†’ Dropbox or OneDrive is better.
